Type system
----------------
- Variables are statically typed and checked at compile-time and specified like `local x:int = 1`.
- The valid types are: `int,float,string,bool,void` as well as arrays and pointer (`[]int` and `*int`)

Function scoping
-----------------
- Functions are scoped globally unlike in Lua so there is no such thing as a "local function".

C interoperability
-------------------
- Ints and floats map to C `int32_t` and `float` type
- Pointer types map to C pointer types
- Most of the standard library will be written in C and just have thin wrappers
- C headers can be imported using `cimport` statement eg `cimport cstdio`

Package Management?
--------------------
A future preposition is a package manager (no idea on a name), which will allow you to easily
install/uninstall packages for the Deimos language.
